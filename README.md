An app that will efficiently calculate your UK Mortgage Monthly Repayments.

UK Mortgage Repayment Calculator
This efficient calculator will help you determine how much your monthly repayments will be for a given mortgage deal.

How it works:

Enter the Loan Amount for the mortgage. For example: if the property purchase price is £250.000 and your deposit is £30.000, then the Loan Amount will be £220.000 (£250.000 - £30.000 = £220.000);
Enter the interest rate in percentages that you will have for the fixed interest rate period;
And lastly, enter the number of years that this mortgage will last for. This is typically between 20 and 35 years. After the data is inserted in the fields, you can click the "Get a free estimate" button and your monthly repayment amount will be displayed in the input section.
